<h1> Bedwars <h1/>
Bedwars is a widely played game across the entire globe. The game consists of multiple islands that players occupy and try to reach. Some of these islands are Emerald generators, found in mid. Diamond generators found between islands and base islands. A base island belongs to a team randomly assigned to a color and the goal is to be the last one standing. Upon death you can respawn if your bed has not been broken. The way to eliminate a team for good is to destroy the bed and then get what is called a “final kill” which is when the team cannot respawn anymore as their bed is destroyed. Players usually build what is called a defense around their bed to stop others from reaching it. The players obtain items from a shop with a currency of iron and gold (which generates at a base island) and emeralds found in mid island. You can also buy team upgrades which effect the whole team and don’t go away after death such as protection.
